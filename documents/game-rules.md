# Mortgage Backed Monopoly — Game Rules

> *"If they did it in 2008, it's fair game."*

---

## 1. Overview

Mortgage Backed Monopoly is a fully-digital, multiplayer parody of Monopoly layered with Wall Street financial mechanics. On top of buying properties and collecting rent, players can:

- **IPO their properties** — bundle them into corporations, issue shares, and sell equity to other players
- **Issue debt** — borrow cash at the room's debt rate, with compounding interest
- **Trade freely** — swap cash and properties through the Market tab

The game runs entirely in the browser; there are no physical components, no banker, and no manual bookkeeping. All state is shared in real time.

This document assumes you already know standard Monopoly. It focuses on the new mechanics and the app's UI flow.

### Creating a Room

1. After logging in, click **Create Room** on the lobby page.
2. Share the invite code shown on screen with the other players.
3. Wait in the lobby until all players have joined.

### Joining a Room

1. Enter the invite code a friend shared with you and click **Join Room**.
2. You will appear in the lobby player list.

### Starting the Game

Only the host (room creator) can start the game. Once at least two players have joined, the host clicks **Start Game**. All players are redirected to the game screen automatically.

### Starting Cash

Each player begins with **$1,500**.

## 3. Standard Monopoly Rules

The following standard rules apply as normal:

- **Movement**: On your turn, roll two dice and move your token clockwise that many spaces.
- **GO**: Collect **$200** each time you pass or land on GO.
- **Taxes**: Landing on Income Tax costs $200; Luxury Tax costs $100.
- **Chance & Community Chest**: Draw a card and follow its instructions. Effects are applied automatically.
- **Free Parking**: No effect — just a rest square.

Differences or additions are noted in the sections below.

## 4. UI Tabs

The game screen has four tabs accessible via the top navigation bar:

| Tab | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| **Game** | Main action hub — player cards, turn status, action buttons |
| **Market** | Execute trades and direct payments between players |
| **Log** | Full timestamped history of every game event |
| **Board** | Visual board — roll dice, move your token, buy houses/hotels |

**Board** is where movement happens. **Game** is where you manage assets (buy property, create IPOs, manage debt). Most turns involve switching between the two.

---

## 5. Movement & the Board Tab

1. Switch to the **Board** tab on your turn.
2. Click **Roll Dice** — your token moves automatically.
3. A toast notification describes what happened (e.g., "unowned — buy it via the Game tab", "rent owed", "Chance card drawn").
4. Rent, taxes, and card effects are applied automatically and recorded in the log.
5. You can roll again only if you rolled doubles; otherwise, complete your actions and click **End Turn** in the **Game** tab.

End Turn is only valid after the current player has rolled. The UI disables it before rolling, and the server rejects unrolled end-turn actions.

**Rolling three consecutive doubles** sends you directly to Jail.

---

## 6. Buying Property

When you land on an unowned property:

1. A toast shows: *"[Property] is unowned — buy it via the Game tab."*
2. Switch to the **Game** tab and click **Buy Property**.
3. Review the property and fixed purchase price.
4. Click **Buy Property** — the price is deducted from your cash immediately.

If you choose not to buy the property, click **Start Auction** from the purchase modal:

- Active players bid or pass from the **Game** tab.
- Bids must exceed the current high bid and must be affordable by the bidder.
- The current high bidder is committed and cannot pass.
- When every other active player has passed, the high bidder pays the winning bid and receives the property.
- If every active player passes before any bid, the property remains unowned.
- Auctions have a two-minute idle timeout by default. Bids and passes refresh the timeout.
- The next game action after timeout resolves the auction automatically: the high bidder wins, or the property remains unowned if there were no bids.
- The current turn cannot end until the auction resolves.
- The host can cancel a stuck auction. Canceling an auction does not move cash or property.

You cannot buy property when it is not your turn.

---

## 7. Houses & Hotels

You may buy houses or a hotel on any property where you own the **complete color group** (all properties of that color).

1. Switch to the **Board** tab on your turn.
2. If you own a complete group, the **Buy Houses** button appears.
3. Use the **+/−** controls to select how many houses to add to each property in the group.
4. Click **Confirm** — the total cost is deducted from your cash.

### House Costs per Color Group

| Color Group | Cost per House |
|------------|---------------|
| Brown | $50 |
| Light Blue | $50 |
| Pink | $100 |
| Orange | $100 |
| Red | $150 |
| Yellow | $150 |
| Green | $200 |
| Dark Blue | $200 |

A **hotel** is the 5th improvement on a property (displayed as "H" on the board). Hotels cost the same per step as houses.

---

## 8. Rent

### Regular Properties

| Improvements | Rent |
|-------------|------|
| Unimproved, no monopoly | Base rent (printed on property) |
| Unimproved, monopoly | 2× base rent |
| 1 House | Rent table index 1 |
| 2 Houses | Rent table index 2 |
| 3 Houses | Rent table index 3 |
| 4 Houses | Rent table index 4 |
| Hotel | Rent table index 5 |

Owning all properties of a color (a **monopoly**) doubles the base rent even without houses.

### Railroads

Rent scales with how many railroads you own:

| Railroads Owned | Rent |
|----------------|------|
| 1 | $25 |
| 2 | $50 |
| 3 | $100 |
| 4 | $200 |

### Utilities

Rent = dice roll × multiplier:

| Utilities Owned | Multiplier |
|----------------|-----------|
| 1 | ×4 |
| 2 | ×10 |

### Paying Rent

When you land on an owned property, rent is transferred automatically and recorded in the log. The Game tab shows recent cash flow so players can see what they paid and received.

---

## 9. IPOs (Corporations)

Any player may bundle one or more of their properties into a corporation and sell shares to other players.

### Creating an IPO

1. On your turn, go to the **Game** tab and click **Create IPO**.
2. Select the properties to include as corporate assets.
3. Set a **ticker symbol** (e.g., `MBS`), the **number of shares** to issue, and the **price per share**.
4. Click **Create** — the selected properties transfer into the corporation and you start with all shares.

### Selling Shares

Other players can buy available shares from the **Corporations** modal (accessible via the **Game** tab during their turn). When a player buys shares:

- Their cash is deducted by `shares × price per share`.
- The payment goes into the corporation treasury.
- The buyer's shareholding is recorded on the corporation ledger.

### Founder Mechanics

The founder starts as chairman. The public shareholder ledger begins empty, and purchased shares reduce the corporation's available share count. The founder cannot buy shares in their own corporation.

### Corporation Value in Net Worth

A player's stake in any corporation contributes `sharesOwned × pricePerShare` to their net worth at game end.

### Corporation Insolvency

If a corporation's treasury falls below $0 when corporate debt interest is charged, the corporation is closed as insolvent:

- Corporation-owned properties return to the bank and any houses/hotels are cleared.
- Corporation debts are wiped.
- Shareholder positions are wiped, available shares become 0, and the share price becomes $0.
- The chairman seat is cleared and open chairman votes are closed.
- Insolvent corporations cannot collect rent, sell shares, issue debt, or use chairman governance controls.

The Corporations modal shows an **Insolvent** badge and explains that assets, debt, shares, and governance were closed.

---

## 10. Debt & Interest

Players can issue themselves debt at the room's debt rate — simulating leveraged buyouts, margin loans, or mortgage-backed instruments.

### Issuing Debt

1. Go to the **Game** tab → **Manage Debt** → select **Issue New Debt**.
2. Enter the loan amount. Optionally select collateral properties (informational only — collateral is not seized automatically).
3. Click **Confirm** — cash is added to your balance immediately.

### Interest Accrual

Interest compounds **every time you end your turn**:

```
New principal = principal × (1 + interestRate / 100)
Interest charged = new principal − old principal
```

The interest charged is deducted from your cash at turn end, before bankruptcy is checked. This means a high-interest loan can spiral quickly.

The default room debt rate is **5% per turn**.

### Repaying Debt

1. Go to **Manage Debt** → select **Settle Debt**.
2. Choose the loan from the dropdown and enter a payment amount.
3. The payment reduces the principal. If the principal reaches $0 or below, the debt is fully cleared.

Partial payments are allowed.

---

## 11. Bankruptcy

Bankruptcy is triggered automatically when your **cash drops below $0 at the end of your turn** or when you end the turn with an **unpaid rent claim**.

- A `BANKRUPT` flag is set on your account.
- The game log shows a bankruptcy announcement.
- You can no longer act through the server API.
- Pending trade offers involving you are canceled automatically.
- You are **skipped** in the turn order.
- Your personal debts are cleared.
- If you were a corporation chairman, chairmanship passes to the active non-bankrupt shareholder with the most shares. If no active shareholder exists, it falls back to an active non-bankrupt founder. If neither exists, the chair is left vacant.
- Open chairman votes involving you are closed.
- A liquidation summary appears after bankruptcy so players can see the cause, destination of assets, share movement, and debt cleanup.

If you cannot afford rent owed to another player or corporation, you pay only the cash you actually have and the unpaid remainder is tracked as a claim. If you raise enough cash before ending the turn, that claim is paid and bankruptcy is avoided. If the claim is still unpaid when you end the turn:

- Rent owed to a player transfers your directly owned properties and player-held corporation shares to that player.
- Rent owed to a corporation transfers your directly owned properties to that corporation. Player-held shares return to their issuing corporation's available share pool.
- Houses/hotels on transferred properties are removed.

Bank, tax, card, jail bail, and interest bankruptcies return your directly owned properties to the bank and return player-held shares to their issuing corporation's available share pool. Bankruptcy is final. Corporation-owned properties and corporation debts stay with the corporation unless that corporation later becomes insolvent.

## 12. Trading & Payments

### Player-to-Player Trades

Trades let two players exchange any combination of cash and properties after both involved players agree.

1. Go to the **Market** tab.
2. Select **Player 1** and **Player 2** from the dropdowns.
3. Enter how much cash each player contributes to the swap.
4. Check the properties each player is transferring.
5. Click **Propose Transaction** — the offer appears under **Pending Trade Offers**.
6. The other involved player accepts to execute the transfer, or declines to reject it.

Pending trade offers expire after the configured trade-offer timeout. Expired offers never move cash or properties; the next game action clears the offer and logs the expiration. The host can also cancel abandoned pending trade offers. Host cancellation does not move cash or properties.

Trades can be proposed and accepted at any time, not only on your turn. The acting player must be one side of the trade. There is no built-in chat yet — arrange the terms in chat or voice first.

### Direct Payments

For simple cash transfers (rent side-deals, fines, gifts):

1. Go to the **Market** tab → **Direct Payment** section.
2. Select the recipient and amount.
3. Click **Pay** — funds move instantly.

---

## 13. Jail

### Getting Sent to Jail

- Landing on the **Go to Jail** square (position 30).
- Drawing a "Go to Jail" Chance or Community Chest card.
- Rolling **three consecutive doubles** in one turn.

### Escaping Jail

On each turn while in Jail, roll the dice:

- **Roll doubles** → released immediately; move that many spaces.
- **No doubles, turns 1–2** → still in Jail; turn ends.
- **No doubles, turn 3** → forced to pay **$50 bail**, then move.

Leaving Jail by rolling doubles or by forced third-turn bail consumes that turn's roll; you do not roll again afterward.

If you hold a **Get Out of Jail Free** card (from a Chance or Community Chest draw), it is used automatically on your next jail turn.

While in Jail you can still buy properties, create IPOs, manage debt, and trade via the Market tab.

---

## 14. Winning

### Automatic Win

If all players except one are bankrupt, the game ends automatically and that player is declared the winner.

### Host-Ended Game

At any point, the **host** can click **End Game**. The game ends immediately and winners are ranked by net worth.

### Host Pause / Resume

The host can pause a live game from the game screen. While paused, normal player actions are blocked for everyone and the game shows a paused banner. The host can resume the game, end it, or clear stuck auctions and trade offers. Pause and resume actions are written to the game log and event stream.

---

## 15. Net Worth Formula

When the game ends, final standings are determined by:

```
Net Worth = Cash
          + Sum of owned property values
          + Sum of (sharesOwned × pricePerShare) across all corporations
          − Total outstanding debt principal
```

Property value is recorded at purchase price. There is no market appreciation or depreciation of individual properties — their book value stays at what you paid (or what was set when transferred in a trade).
